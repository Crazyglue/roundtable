    "objective": "Roll out the approved distributed batch platform plan across API, scheduler, controller, staging/log mesh, and verification suites.",
    "recommendedExecutorProfile": "Platform Delivery Lead with infra and ops experience.",
    "steps": [
      "Phase1: release API/auth/quotas plus stateless scheduler and single node pool, validating placement and quota rejection flows.",
      "Phase2: deploy execution controller, agents, staging/log mesh, verifying heartbeats, retries, signed URLs, and ≤5s telemetry latency.",
      "Phase3: add telemetry dashboards, checkpoint idempotency checks, high-throughput staging quotas, and failure monitoring/alerts.",
      "Phase4: scale multi-node runtimes, autoscale node pools, enable alerts, and run CI chaos tests for quota breaches, heartbeat loss, and node failures."
    ],
    "risks": [
      "Quota cache drift causing oversubscription or unnecessary rejections.",
      "Controller/agent heartbeat loss leaving multi-node jobs hanging.",
      "Data staging throttles or log relay saturation degrading workloads.",
      "Retry storms producing duplicate outputs if checkpoints fail.",
      "Node pool exhaustion delaying scheduling and frustrating tenants."
    ],
    "acceptanceCriteria": [
      "Scheduler responds within 2s with placement or rejection when tenant usage hits ≥90%.",
      "Controller resolves heartbeat loss within 10s, retries/fails within job window, and prevents duplicate artifacts.",
      "Telemetry/log progress delivered within 5s via the streaming relay.",
      "Tenant staging throughput stays within quotas while using ≥70% NIC without oversubscription.",
      "CI validates quota breaches, heartbeat loss, node failures, and checkpoint dedupe before full rollout."
